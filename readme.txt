Improves your site's page load speed by preventing NextGEN's scripts & css from loading on posts without galleries.

== Description ==

= NextGEN Gallery Optimizer =

Improves your site's page load speed by ensuring NextGEN Gallery's scripts and styles ONLY load on posts with the [nggallery id=x] shortcode.

It also includes and integrates the fantastic Fancybox lightbox script, so now you can have gorgeous galleries AND a speedy site! *Requires NextGEN Gallery 1.6.2 and up.

Please note: This basic version currently only supports the **[nggallery id=x]** shortcode.

= NextGEN Gallery Optimizer *Premium* =

Builds on the basic version and adds support for ALL TEN of NextGen's shortcodes including **[nggallery id=x]**, **[slideshow id=x]**, **[album id=x]**, **[thumb id=x]**, **[singlepic id=x]**, **[imagebrowser id=x]**, **[nggtags gallery|album=mytag]**, **[random max=x]**, **[recent max=x]** and **[tagcloud]**.

It also adds support for the **[Show as slideshow]** link (loading slideshow scripts only after a user clicks-through), precision targeting for **shortcode SUB-pages** (ensuring we only load the scripts we need on each view) and also **removes NextGEN's version number comment** (for less clutter behind every page).

This donation-based version is available from the plugin settings page, [or can be downloaded here](http://www.markstechnologynews.com/nextgen-gallery-optimizer-premium).

= Key features: =
1. Improves your WordPress page load speed!
2. Prevents NextGEN's scripts and styles from loading on posts without galleries.
3. Lets you easily install the Fancybox lightbox to display your images in style.

= NEW in Version 1.0.5: =

1. Precision matching with WordPress's built-in shortcode finder.
2. NextGEN Gallery Optimizer *Premium* (an optional upgrade for a small donation).


This version uses WordPress's native get_shortcode_regex() function for EXACT shortcode matching, ensuring scripts and styles don't load unexpectedly unless the FULL shortcode is present. If WordPress doesn't detect a shortcode, neither do we!

Also, this update introduces the new NextGEN Gallery Optimizer *Premium* version, which adds support for ALL TEN of NextGen's shortcodes, support for the [show as slideshow] link, the removal of NextGEN's version number comment and more.


= NEW in Version 1.0.4: =

1. Easier set up

This version automatically redirects first time users to the options page on activation and sets a default stylesheet for easier set up.


= NEW in Version 1.0.3: =

1. Optimized code for better compatibility and page load speed 
2. Improved settings page

This update results in faster page loads on gallery pages by avoiding duplicate scripts. It reduces the chance of conflicts with other plugins and makes setting up Fancybox even easier.


= NEW in Version 1.0.2: =

1. Support for WordPress Pages
2. Fancybox overlap fix
3. Fix for Fancybox not working in IE6 & IE8
4. Latest JQuery

This update lets you display galleries on both Posts AND Pages in style, but only load code when they're present.

It also fixes an issue where some page elements overlap Fancybox and prevent the close button from functioning (in particular the title text, header image and menu bar in Twenty Eleven).

It fixes the "Fancybox not working in IE6 & IE8" issue by automatically updating the Fancybox stylesheet to use the correct file paths, and we're now running Fancybox on  JQuery version 1.7.1, resulting in faster page loads where galleries are present.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `nextgen-gallery-optimizer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Proceed to the plugin settings page to complete installation.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Basic Version =
 
= Wait...my galleries are displaying in a vertical line! =

Please make sure you've selected a stylesheet on the (NextGEN Optimizer) settings page, and that you're using the [nggallery id=x] shortcode in your posts. This is the only supported shortcode in the basic version presently.


= My image thumbnails are clicking-through to an image URL! Where did the lightbox go? =

By design, the plugin strips NextGEN's sitewide scripts and styles (including those for lightboxes) and lets you insert your own...only where they're needed. 

Currently, NextGEN Optimizer lets you add the free and fabulous Fancybox lightbox to your gallery thumbs. Other effects are on the way...

To set up Fancybox, please check it's checkbox on the (NextGEN Optimizer) settings page. After you save, just go to Gallery --> Options --> Effects, select Custom and enter: **class="myfancybox" rel="%GALLERY_NAME%"** to complete the installation.

This will integrate the Fancybox lightbox with NextGEN Gallery on your [nggallery id=x] shortcodes instead of directing you to the image URL.


= Premium Version =
 
= Why won't my images click-through to a gallery on my [album id=x] shortcodes? =

It looks as though there may be a bug with one of NextGEN's settings. Go to Gallery --> Options --> Gallery Settings and make sure the first option "Deactivate gallery page link" is checked (as it is by default).

= I've just added a gallery to an album in NextGEN and I get a "Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$gallery_ids" error message on my page. =

The drag-and-drop "Manage Albums" page in NextGEN does not auto-save like the WordPress widgets page. Click the "Update" button and your albums will display as they should.


= General =
 
= Is this plugin compatible with minification/caching tools? =

Yes. However the small, already minified Fancybox script must be excluded from combining/minification or it won't function. This is true of any lightbox script.

For WP Minify, simply add /wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery-optimizer/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js in its js file exclusion options and clear the cache.

For W3 Total Cache, do nothing. It doesn't auto-discover, so as long as you don't manually add the script, it won't be included.


= What version of NextGEN Gallery is this plugin compatible with? =

Any version since 1.6.2

== Changelog ==

= V1.0.5 - 20/03/2012 =

* Replaced my shortcode regex with WordPress's native get_shortcode_regex() function for more precise matching.

* Added a pre-emptive fix to solve a common problem where jQuery dependent scripts (such as Fancybox and NextGEN's slideshow) break if jQuery doesn't load first. Added array('jquery') dependencies to wp_register_script calls (which forces jQuery to not only load when these scripts are called, but load first), as well as add_action priority values to influence their order.

* Launched my new NextGEN Gallery Optimizer *Premium* version which supports ALL TEN of NextGen's shortcodes, supports the [show as slideshow] link, adds targeting for shortcode sub-pages (eg. stylesheet only on album page / both styles and scripts (if selected) on album GALLERY pages) and adds the removal of NextGEN's version number comment.

* Added promotional box to the basic version's settings page.



= V1.0.4 - 18/03/2012 =

* Added an automatic redirect that sends first time users to the plugin options page on first activation.

* Added a one time welcome message on the redirect.

* Added a default setting for the stylesheet in case anyone forgets to set it.

* Added email contact to the settings page and main page at the plugin repository.

* Changed all instances of $nextgen_gallery_optimizer to a global $nggo_options variable for less cumbersome handling of 
database options.

* Moved the stylesheet dropdown if statements to scripts-and-styles.php to keep them together with their register and enqueue calls.



= V1.0.3 - 09/03/2012 =

* Replaced all hard-coded scripts and styles with WordPress's built-in wp_enqueue_scripts and wp_print_styles functions for better compatibility with other plugins.

* Added several instances of wp_deregister_script to pages we're serving jquery and jquery.fancybox.js on. This will prevent conflicts (and page load overhead) if any other installed plugins try to serve duplicate scripts.

* Added /wp-content/ url prefix to custom css input box on the settings page. Also made the Fancybox installation instructions clearer with larger text, a link to the NextGEN Effects page, and extra advice in the Tips section on plugin conflicts.



= V1.0.2 - 07/03/2012 =

* Added support for WordPress Pages

* Fixed an issue where some page elements overlap Fancybox and prevent the close button from functioning (in particular the title text, header image and menu bar in Twenty Eleven).

* Fixed a surprisingly common issue involving Fancybox not working in IE6 & IE8. My solution was to develop a regular expression that runs on the plugin options page ONLY to write the full urls Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader requires into the static Fancybox stylesheet. Much more efficient than some methods I've seen (such as dynamically rebuilding the stylesheet on every page view in php).

* Switched JQuery to the latest version 1.7.1 (Google hosted)



= V1.0.1 - 01/03/2012 =
* Resolved issue regarding upload to WordPress.org repository



= V1.0 - 28/02/2012 =
* Initial release on February 28th, 2012.
