/**
 * NextGEN Gallery Optimizer Basic
 *
 * NextGEN Gallery Optimizer improves your site's page load speed, by
 * preventing NextGEN's scripts and stylesheets from loading on posts and pages
 * *without* NextGEN Gallery content.
 *
 * Additionally...
 *
 * If you're using NextGEN v2.x.xx, Optimizer also provides you with complete
 * granular control of the scripts and stylesheets that load on posts and pages
 * *with* NextGEN Gallery content. For a live example of these settings in action,
 * please view the source of Optimizer's homepage (a NextGEN v2.x.xx gallery
 * page with AJAX pagination) in your browser.
 *
 * If you're using NextGEN Legacy (v1.6.2 to v1.9.13) or the NextCellent
 * Gallery fork, Optimizer will intelligently fine-tune all your posts and pages
 * *with* NextGEN Gallery content automatically... detecting every shortcode
 * and setting, to only load the scripts and stylesheets required on each page.
 *
 * For a full overview of the optimization process, please see...
 * http://www.nextgengalleryoptimizer.com/optimization-flowcharts/
 *
 * Optimizer also includes an *enhanced* version of the fantastic Fancybox
 * lightbox script, and only loads it on appropriate posts and pages *with*
 * NextGEN Gallery content. The result? Gorgeous galleries *and* a speedy site.
 *
 * Optimizer v2.1.1 currently supports (and is tested compatible with) NextGEN
 * Gallery (v2.0.0 to v2.1.0), NextGEN Legacy (v1.6.2 to v1.9.13) and
 * NextCellent Gallery (v1.9.14 to v1.9.26).
 *
 * NextGEN Gallery Optimizer Pro
 *
 * Upgrade to Optimizer Pro for the new "NextGEN Gallery Deactivator" feature.
 * A whole new level of speed optimization.
 * Only load NextGENâ€™s PHP *code* on posts/pages *with* NextGEN Gallery content.
 * http://www.nextgengalleryoptimizer.com/#nextgen-gallery-deactivator
 *
 * Upgrade to Optimizer Pro for the new "Dynamic Fancybox Settings Interface".
 * The fastest and easiest way to customize Fancybox.
 * Set title styles, background color & opacity, make Fancybox responsive & more.
